# WeatherForecastPractice
Using Visual Studio and Swagger, I created a program in C# to gain familiarity with the language and practice using a Web Application (Swagger). Worked with interfaces, null-coalescing, optional paramters, Model Minding, HTTPGet, enumberables vs static variables (lists) IActionResult for BadRequests(), Controllers, and more to begin working with C#. 

## Includes
- Weather forecast for current day
- Weekly weather forecasts for current week
- Weather forecasts based on a specified range (cannot exceed the next 6 months)
- 2 sequential forecasts based on a specified date (cannot exceed the next 2 years)
- Hourly forecast for a specified day (defaults to today if no date is specified)
- Forecast based on a specified hour and day
